# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updated the APIs for adding a suggested video and the video page to show data from MongoDB Atlas.

**Thoughts**: Pretty good progress today, though I think I could have been faster.

**Link(s) to work**: Nothing yet. Will work on a temporary link to showcase it.

### Day 2: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made the UI a bit pretty with SASS. Deployed current app state to Heroku.

**Thoughts**: Worked through even though I fell sick. Didn't want to break the chain on the second day. Could have done more work but it's getting late and past my bedtime. Gotta wake up early tomorrow. ;)

### Day 3: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added an API to get all distinct values from tags array in the video collection. Updated the UI to make filtering simple.

**Thoughts**: Decent progress today. Hoped to finish filtering end to end but it's getting late. Hoping to finish a lot over the weekend.
